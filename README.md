=>While most see a leaf as just biology, I saw it as a challenge: Can I recreate this structure using only math? This project uses iterated function systems (IFS) — a mathematical model that simulates natural fractals —> to generate a fern leaf made entirely of dots, mimicking its real-life pattern and density.

=>🧠 What I Used
Python 🐍
Matplotlib 📊
Fractal geometry (Barnsley Fern)
Basic probability and matrix transformations
A curious mind and low IQ (self-declared 😅)

=>🚀 Why This Project Matters
This isn’t just a fern — it’s a reminder that math is everywhere. It shows how nature’s elegance can be reverse-engineered using logic, math, and a bit of creativity. It’s a small step toward understanding the hidden code of the universe.
